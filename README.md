# XOXOXOXOX
### (Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe)

![](img/next.jpg)

This repo contains the fruits of my efforts to build an unbeatable game of Tic Tac Toe. So far the project has been a harsh lesson in the dangers of too much research, also known as trying to run before walking.

XOXOXOXOX has been constructed completely via TDD using Rspec and is built using Ruby. Future plans are to build a responsive web interface using Sinatra which will have a full suite of Cucumber tests.

Currently the project has no interface because the game is not yet at a playable stage. Later implementations will have a full set of instructions on how to install and play the game.
